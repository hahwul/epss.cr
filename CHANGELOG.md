# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Expose the FIRST API global parameters `fields`, `pretty`, and
  `envelope` on `EPSS::Query`.
- `Query#format_float` now emits decimal notation for very small
  thresholds (previously fell into scientific notation, which the
  upstream API rejected).
- Round out `Query#with_*` builders to cover every parameter.
- Add `EPSS::CSV.feed_url(date)` and `EPSS::CSV.fetch(date)` to construct
  and download the daily feed by date; switch the canonical feed host
  to `epss.empiricalsecurity.com` and accept the legacy
  `epss.cyentia.com` host via the `host:` override.

## v0.1.0

- First release. Includes the EPSS REST API client, daily CSV feed parser
  (gzip auto-detect), `Score` and `Band` value types, time-series
  flattening, JSON round-trip, and Retry-After-aware retries.
